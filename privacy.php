            <p>This Privacy Statement relates to the online information collection and use practices of our Website located at alumni-002 (“Website”). We recognize that visitors and users of this Website are concerned about the information they provide to us, and how we treat that information. This Privacy Statement, which may be updated from time to time, is meant to address those concerns.</p>

<p>Your use of this Website indicates to us that you have read and accept our privacy practices, as outlined in this Privacy Statement. If you have any questions or concerns regarding this Privacy Statement.</p>

<h2>WHAT INFORMATION ABOUT YOU DO WE COLLECT?</h2>

<p>When you visit our Website, you may provide us with two types of information: (1) personally identifiable information that you knowingly choose to disclose, which is collected on an individual basis, and (2) general user information that does not contain personally identifiable information, which is collected on an aggregate basis as you browse the Website.</p>

<h3>Personally Identifiable Information You Choose to Provide.</h3>

<p>We may ask for certain personal information from you for the purpose of providing to you content and/or services that you request. For example, if you indicate an interest in receiving an email newsletter about Alumni Interactive, you are asked to submit your name and email address, which we retain on file, so that we may send you the information you requested. We also request your name and email address each time you contact us by submitting a form on the “Contact” page. We may retain a record of users who have contacted us in order to respond properly to questions or concerns and for purposes of future communications.</p>

<h3>Non-Personally Identifiable Information We Collect.</h3>

<p>Cookies/Web server logs: Similar to other commercial websites, our Website utilizes standard technology called “cookies” and Web server logs to collect information about how our Website is used. Cookies are a feature of Web browser software that allows Web servers to recognize the computer used to access a website. Cookies are small pieces of data that are stored by a user’s Web browser on the user’s hard drive. Information gathered through cookies and Web server logs may include the date and time of visits, the pages viewed, time spent at our Website, 
    and the websites visited just before and just after our Website. This information is collected on an aggregate basis. None of this information is associated with you as an individual.</p>

<p>You can disable cookies on your computer by indicating this in the preferences or options menus in your browser. However, it is possible that some parts of our Website will not operate correctly if you disable cookies. You should consult with your browser’s support if you have any questions regarding disabling cookies. Third Party Services: We may use services hosted by third parties such as Google Analytics, to assist in providing our services and to help us understand how our Website is used. These services may collect information sent by a 
    browser as part of a web page request, including IP addresses or cookies. If these third party services collect information, they do so anonymously and in the aggregate to provide information helpful 
    to us such as website trends, without identifying individual visitors. Please refer to “Cookies” in the section about for information on how you can control the use of cookies on your computer.</p>

<h2>HOW DO WE USE THE INFORMATION WE COLLECT?</h2>

<p>We use your personally identifiable information to provide you with the information or content that you have requested,
     and, in some cases, to contact you about our programs, products, features or services.</p>

<p>We use non-identifying information collected on our Website in the aggregate to better understand your use of the Website and to enhance your enjoyment and experience. For example, we may use the information to improve the design and content of our Website or to analyze the services that we offer.</p>

<p>We may employ other companies and individuals to perform functions on our behalf. Our employees, agents and contractors who have access to personally identifiable information are required to protect the information in a manner that is consistent with this Privacy Statement.</p>

<p>We may provide access to your personally identifiable information when legally required to do so, to cooperate with police investigations or other legal proceedings, to protect against misuse or unauthorized use of our Website, to limit our legal liability and protect our rights, or to protect the rights and safety of visitors to this Website or the public. In those instances, the information is provided only for that limited purpose.</p>

<p>We will not share your personally identifiable information in ways unrelated to those described above without providing you with an opportunity to opt out of such use or otherwise prohibit such unrelated uses.</p>

<h2>PRIVACY PROTECTIONS FOR CHILDREN USING THE INTERNET</h2>

<p>Protecting children's privacy is important to us. For that reason, we do not collect or maintain information on our Website from those we actually know are under the age of 13, nor is any part of our Website targeted to attract anyone under 13. We request that all visitors to our Website who are under 13 not disclose or provide any personally identifiable information. If we discover that a child under 13 has provided us with personally identifiable information, we will delete that child's personally identifiable information from our records.</p>

<h2>DATA SECURITY</h2>

<p>We take reasonable steps to maintain the security of the personally identifiable information that we collect, including limiting the number of people who have physical access to our database servers, as well as installing electronic security systems that guard against unauthorized access. However, no data transmission over the Internet can be guaranteed to be completely secure. Accordingly, we cannot ensure or warrant the security of any information that you transmit to us, so you do so at your own risk.</p>

<h2>CONSENT TO TRANSFER</h2>

<p>This Website is operated in the United States. If you are located outside of the United States, please be aware that any information you provide to us will be transferred to the United States and/or third countries. By using our Website, participating in any of our services and/or providing us with your information, you consent to this transfer.</p>

<h2>LINKS</h2>

<p>This Website contains links to third party sites. Please be aware that Alumni Interactive is not responsible for the privacy practices of any third party sites. This Privacy Statement applies solely to information collected by this Website.</p>
